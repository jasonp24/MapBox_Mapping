## Tile 1 Screenshot - Customized Basemap:

<ul>
  <li>Description of tile: I modified the original basemap by making major roadways more visible by changing the color of major roads to yellow. However, I only changed the color    for major roadways so the color was not too distracting from the basemap. I also increased the visibility of land areas and water bodies to green and blue respectively as well.    Finally, I changed the font of streets to black to distinguish streets from cities in the greater Seattle region</li>
